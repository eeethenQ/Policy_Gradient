# Introduction

This repository is used as the implementations of policy gradient algorithms. 

The reference link is [here](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/04/08/policy-gradient-algorithms.html)

Things to do 

1. Actor-Critic
1. Off-policy Policy Gradient
1. A3C
1. A2C

# Monte Carlo Policy Gradient

Gonna talk about it later
